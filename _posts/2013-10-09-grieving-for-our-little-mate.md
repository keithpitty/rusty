title: Grieving for our little mate

This coming February he would have been living with us for nine years. In April he would have turned ten.

But today we had to let him go.

It has been tough during these last few months watching our little mate struggle. To see him go from a lively, mischievous little bloke who loved to run around our back yard with abandon, to a dog who cautiously negotiated his way around the house, constantly bumping into furniture, was heart-breaking. That was the practical reality of him doing his best to deal with a condition known to vets as hepatic encephalopathy, one that affects the brain due to liver disease. In Rusty's case, his liver appears to have been damaged by years of medication for epilipsy.

The condition left him confused and practically blind.

It left us clutching to hope. We held onto the hope that the vet's best case prognosis of his liver recovering with the help of a change in medication and an altered diet would come true.

However, the weeks passed and Rusty's condition stayed much the same.

Then a few days ago when he took a turn for the worse. He had developed some obstructions that were preventing him from passing urine freely. A small operation helped to relieve his condition but a subsequent major operation would have been required to fully clear the obstructions. Given that this latest illness was most likely a result of the liver disease, and that the ongoing prognosis was not good, we were faced with following the vet's advice that it was time to say goodbye.

To say that Rusty has been a much loved part of our family is an understatement. It was an agonising decision but one which we knew we must make for the good of our little mate. We couldn't put him through any more suffering. It was tempting for me to think that the second operation would then give Rusty the chance for his liver to improve but, when I reflected, this was a forlorn hope.

So this morning, after having Rusty come home from hospital for one last night with us, we said our tearful farewells. During those last few hours at home with us, it was painfully clear to us how much our little mate was suffering.

As hard as it was for me to say goodbye to our much loved mate, in my heart of hearts I know that his suffering is over, and that we shared a special bond. In the days and weeks to come, I'm sure I'll focus more on the good times we shared.

I only have a few old photos of him from when he was a three year-old, but they are a special reminder of his healthy, happy days.

It is often said that your dog will love you unconditionally. So it was with Rusty. He was the best of mates and I will forever treasure our time together.
