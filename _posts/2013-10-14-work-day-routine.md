The fact that I have usually worked from home for the last six years meant that Rusty and I shared a lot of time whilst I was working.

For the better part of the morning, Rusty would adopt a pose that endeared him to many a visitor. He would take advantage of the northerly aspect of our bedrooms and position himself between the blinds and the windows. He could stand there for hours soaking up the sun.

As much as Rusty loved soaking up the sun, he also craved company. So, before the work day was very old, he would make his presence felt in my office. Appearing just inside the doorway, he would sit and use his voice to let me know that it was time to attend to a little task for his benefit. The bean bag that he slept in overnight needed to be moved from Rosie's room to my office. I would obediently oblige and Rusty would then make himself comfortable. This usually involved several minutes of him arranging the shape of the bean bag so that it was just right. Only then would he relax. Familiar sounds of Rusty snoring in the background often soon followed.

Then there were the times when storms approached. I wonder what it is about thunder that seems to terrify dogs. Rusty was certainly no exception. I knew a storm was approaching if he became very clingy. He would abandon the comfort of his bean bag, walk under my desk and try to negotiate his way onto my lap. This obviously made it challenging for me to get much work done!

Spending time with Rusty often involved negotiation.

Often, towards the end of the work day, Rusty became restless and would let me know that he thought it was time to play. And by "play" he meant with me involved. Playing by himself with his favourite toy of the time didn't count. I would have to be firm with him and let him know that I still had work to do. After I'd finished for the day, I'd often indulge him in a favourite game. This involved me chasing him around the house or the garden, pretending that I thought I could catch him, which of course never happened.

During these last few months, however, the chasing game wasn't an option due to Rusty's failing eyesight. Walks became more frequent. Being on a lead appeared to give him a sense of freedom because he could be guided rather than forever bumping into things.

My work days at home are certainly not the same without Rusty. However, when I'm in my office and think of him, at least I can smile as I remember his "work day routine".
